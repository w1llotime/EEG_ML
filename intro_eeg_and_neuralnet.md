## Introduction to EEG and Machine Learning
This is the beginning of my notes for EEG signal processing and neural networks. I will mainly be taking notes from 2 sources 1) EEG Signal Processing and Machine Learning Textbook, 2) Coursera Courses about neural networks.

# Neural Networks and Computer Vision
Hubel and Wiesel, 1959 - different electrical recordings of the cat's brain when shown different slides.  
They discovered simple cells - responsible for detecting edges at particular positions in the cat's visual field. Neuron may fire when edge is detected. Complex cells - light orientation and movement. Hypercomplex cells - movement.

Hierarchichal representation of visual system. Building from simple cells to complex cells! Later we will do MNIST which will be very helpful.
Larry Roberts, 1963 - original picture -> differentiated picture -> feature points selected -> 3d gemometry.
1970s - detect not just basic shapes and edges, pictorial structures
1980s - recognition via edge detection. Matching edges through comparing edges in images.
1990s - recognition via grouping semantically meaningful chunks.
2000s - extracting feature vectors (that somehow presersves info about the image) that can later be compared and manipulated.
- Face detection (algorithms)
2010s - Hinton - deep convolutional neural network called AlexNet
History of Deep Learning
Perceptron - it was a physical machine! The weights were potentiometers (I suppose changing electric current with respect to how important a signal is)
- linear classifier
Multi-layer perceptron - can learn many types of functions
1986 - hinton, method for training multi-layer percpetrons through back propagation. m - alpha * dL/dm
CNN -
